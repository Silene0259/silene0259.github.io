# silene0259.github.io - Inspired Note Drops and Other Secrets

## Notice and Warning

This content may be too **triggering** or **offensive** for some to handle. It deals with **heavy topics** like mental illness, religion, substance abuse, heartbreak, and love and can be dark in nature. It also has some hidden parts / secrets to it that you may find interesting. Please take caution when you view it. A lot of it has to be interpreted and I left a few secrets in the art. I treat different accounts with different respect.

I **do not** condone substance use and some of the topics discussed. This is merely **self-expression** and was done while I was inspired and mentally ill.

### Looking For Computer Science Related Content

If you are looking for the side related to programming, cryptography, development, and security then I will let you know that it is not quite ready but will be in the future.
